# Friend-Emulator
Generating a NLP Model to replicate and replace my friends on WhatsApp

I wanted to see whether I could generate a neural network model to simulate the diction of my friends, by using the data of our group chat on WhatsApp.

WhatsApp allows you to export the 40000 most recent messages to a txt file.  Here's an excerpt from the raw file:
```

# Pre-processing
Firstly preprocessing to remove the "<Media omitted>" messages, timestamps, categorize by user
